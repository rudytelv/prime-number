# Multithreaded Prime Numbers

This is a quick project I made to display the effectiveness of multithreading by calculating the prime numbers in the range (2^0, 2^16].

## Usage

For those of you who want to test out the capabilities of multithreading,
```bash
make main
./main
```

For others who would rather execute serially,
```bash
make st
./st
```

And to clean,
```bash
make clean
```
